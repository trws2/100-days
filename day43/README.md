    - Domain name service
        - Why does DNS sacrifice strong consistency to achieve high performance and scalability?
            - This is due to the following reasons:
                - Response from DNS must be returned swiftly to resolve the IP address of a web url. Therefore, the DNS service must achieve high performance.
                - We have billions of users from around the world that need to use DNS to get IP addressed to access internet. Therefore, the DNS service must achieve scalability.
                - DNS prioritizes **eventual consistency** because it processes significantly more read operations than write operations. Updates to DNS records propagate lazily, allowing for faster responses to queries without overloading the infrastructure.
        - what is the difference between UDP and TCP?
            - In computer networks, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are two fundamental protocols for data transmission. Here are the key differences between them:
                - Connection Type
                    - TCP: Connection-oriented. It establishes a connection before data transfer.
                    - UDP: Connectionless. It sends data without establishing a connection.
                - Reliability
                    - TCP: Reliable. It ensures data is received in order and without errors, using acknowledgments and retransmissions.
                    - UDP: Unreliable. There are no guarantees for delivery, order, or error-checking.
                - Speed
                    - TCP: Slower due to handshaking and error-checking mechanisms.
                    - UDP: Faster since it has minimal overhead and no connection establishment.
                - Data Transmission
                    - TCP: Data is sent as a stream of bytes, maintaining order.
                    - UDP: Data is sent as discrete packets, without a guarantee of order.
                - Use Cases
                    - TCP: Suitable for applications where accuracy is crucial (e.g., web browsing, email).
                    - UDP: Ideal for applications that require speed and can tolerate some data loss (e.g., video streaming, online gaming).
                - Header Size
                    - TCP: Larger header (20 bytes minimum) due to additional control information.
                    - UDP: Smaller header (8 bytes), leading to less overhead.
                - In sum, TCP is reliable and ordered, making it suitable for critical data transmission, while UDP is faster and simpler, ideal for applications that prioritize speed over reliability.
        - DNS caching improves performance but introduces the risk of stale data. Suppose an organization updates its websiteâ€™s IP address, but many users still access the old IP due to caching. Propose a strategy to minimize disruption in such scenarios.
            - Set a short TTL so that updated record can be fetched.
            - Use a CDN to help mitigate the cache issue, as CDNs often have their own cache mechanisms and can route user to the correct content regardless of DNS caching
            - Inform user that there is an update in IP address
            - Maintain both old and new IP addresses for a period of time before the old address is gone, make both address point to the same server or load balancer.
