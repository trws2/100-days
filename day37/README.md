Day 37:

- continue grind 75 coding problems
- taking [machine learning system design course](https://www.educative.io/courses/machine-learning-system-design) from educative.io
  - feature selection and engineering: 
    - categorical features, numerical features
    - one-hot encoding
    - embedding features
    - feature normalization/standardization
    - feature hashing/clustering/bucketing
    - crossed features (e.g. (latitude, longitude) pairs)
  - review common loss functions (**the topic here is so big that it may need a separate node to discuss**)
    - classification loss
      - logloss
      - cross-entropy loss
      - hinge loss
    - regression loss
      - mean squared error (MSE) (L2 loss)
      - mean absolute error (MAE) (L1 loss)
    - ranking loss
      - pairwise ranking loss
  - what is cold storage? why it exists?
    - Cold storage refers to a data storage solution that is not actively accessed or used on a regular basis. It is typically used for data that is infrequently accessed but still needs to be retained for long-term storage due to compliance, legal, or historical reasons. **Cold storage is generally cheaper than hot storage (which is used for data that needs to be accessed frequently) because it uses slower, less expensive storage technology.**
    - Example: imagine a company that collects customer transaction data. They actively analyze data from the last six months to make business decisions and improve customer service. However, data older than a year is rarely accessed, as it is less relevant for day-to-day operations. **To save costs, the company keeps the last six months of transaction data in a fast, readily accessible database (hot storage) for analysis. Meanwhile, they move the older data (from one year ago and beyond) to cold storage.** This cold storage could be a service like Amazon S3 Glacier or a tape-based storage system, where the data is stored more cheaply but may take longer to retrieve when needed. **In this way, the company saves on storage costs while still adhering to data retention policies.**
