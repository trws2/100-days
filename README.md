# 100 days of Learning/Coding

This repo serves as a record to track my learning of DL for 100 days.

- Day 1-3: Implements a Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch for language translation task ([ref](https://github.com/trws2/transformer_with_pytorch))
- Day 4-5: Implement [YouTube Video to Doc (vid2doc) for Quick Video Content Reading](https://github.com/trws2/vid2doc)
- Day 6: Start learning CUDA and code [add.cu](https://github.com/trws2/100-days/tree/main/day06)
- Day 7: Slides for [RL is Almost All Your Need in Post-Training](https://github.com/trws2/100-days/blob/main/day07/RL%20is%20Almost%20All%20Your%20Need%20in%20Post-Training.pdf)
- Day 8: Learn [AI by hand](https://github.com/trws2/100-days/tree/main/day08)
- Day 9-11: Learn [LLMer videos](https://github.com/trws2/100-days/tree/main/day09-11). The best LLM educational videos for me so far.
- Day 12: Learn [LLM Reasoning: Key Ideas and Limitations](https://llmagents-learning.org/slides/llm-reasoning.pdf)
- Day 13-14: Build [a small LLM based text from two books](https://github.com/trws2/finance_data/tree/main)
- Day 15: Started [aiml-jit](https://github.com/trws2/aiml-jit)
- Day 16: general coding pattern organization started [ref](https://github.com/trws2/100-days/blob/main/day16/README.md)
- Day 17: start practicing general coding problems [ref](https://github.com/trws2/100-days/tree/main/day17)
- Day 17-36: practicing [Grind 75 problems](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/?hours=8)
- Day 37: continue Grind 75 problems and taking machine learning system design from educative.io [ref](https://github.com/trws2/100-days/tree/main/day37)
- Day 38: continue Grind 75 problems.
- Day 39: completed machine learning system design from educative.io and obtained the certificate. Checkout ML system design template. [ref](https://github.com/trws2/100-days/tree/main/day39)
- Day 40-48: finish Grind 75 problems and continue to neetcode 150 and started grokking the modern system design interview from educative.io.
- Day 49: continue neetcode 150 and practice [ml coding from deep-ml.com](https://github.com/trws2/aiml-jit/tree/main/src/MLC)
